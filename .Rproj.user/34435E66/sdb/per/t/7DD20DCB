We are going to use it to learn how to create\nplots using the `ggformula` package.\n\n```{r, echo = FALSE}\ngf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1978)\n```\n\n### Two important questions\n\nTo get R (or any software) to create this plot (or do anything else, really),\nthere are two important questions you must be able to answer.  Before\ncontinuing, see if you can figure out what they are.\n\n### The Questions\n\nTo get R (or any software) to create this plot, there are two\nimportant questions you must be able to answer:\n  \n#### 1. What do you want the computer to do?\n  \n#### 2. What must the computer know in order to do that?\n  \n### Answers to the questions\n  \n  \n  To make this plot, the answers to our questions are \n\n#### 1. What do you want the computer to do?\n\n**A.** Make a scatter plot (i.e., a **plot** consisting of **points**)\n\n#### 2. What must the computer know in order to do that?\n\n**A.** The data used for the plot:\n  \n  * The variable to be plotted along the $y$ axis.\n* The variable to be plotted along the $x$ axis.\n* The data set that contains the variables.\n\nWe just need to learn how to tell R these answers.     \n\n\n## Plotting with Formulas\n\n### The Formula Template\n\nWe will provide answers to our two questions by filling in\nthe boxes of this important template:\n  \n  \n  <center>\n  <h2><strong><span class=\"invboxed\">goal</span> ( <span class=\"invboxed\">yyy</span> ~ <span class=\"invboxed\">xxx</span> , data = <span class=\"invboxed\">mydata</span> )</strong> \n  </h2></center>\n  \n  &nbsp;\n\nWe just need to identify which portions of our answers go into which boxes.\n\n### The Name of the Game\n\nIt is useful to provide names for the boxes:\n  \n  <center>\n  <h2><strong><span class=\"boxed\">goal</span> ( <span class=\"boxed\">&nbsp;y&nbsp;</span> ~ <span class=\"boxed\">&nbsp;x&nbsp;</span> , data = <span class=\"boxed\">mydata</span> , ...)</strong> \n  </h2></center>\n  &nbsp;\n\nThese names can help us remember which things go where.\n(The `...` indicates that there are some additional arguments we will add\n  eventually.)\n\n#### Other versions\n\nSometimes we will add or subtract a bit from our formula.\nHere are some other forms we will eventually see.\n\n```{r eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}\n# simpler version\ngoal( ~ x, data = mydata )          \n# fancier version\ngoal( y ~ x | z , data = mydata )   \n# unified version\ngoal( formula , data = mydata )     \n```\n\n### 2 Questions and the Formula Template\n\n\n&nbsp;\n<center>\n  <h2><strong><span class=\"boxed\">goal</span> ( <span class=\"boxed\">&nbsp;y&nbsp;</span> ~ <span class=\"boxed\">&nbsp;x&nbsp;</span> , data = <span class=\"boxed\">mydata</span> )</strong> \n  </h2></center>\n  \n  &nbsp;\n\n\n#### Q. What do you want R to do?  A. goal\n\n* This determines the function to use.\n* For a plot, the function will describe what sorts of marks to draw (points, in our example).\n\n\n#### Q. What must R know to do that?  A. arguments \n\n* This determines the inputs to the function.\n* For a plot, we must identify the variables and the data frame that contains them.\n\n## Assembling the pieces\n\n#### Template\n\n&nbsp;\n<center>\n  <h2><strong><span class=\"boxed\">goal</span> ( <span class=\"boxed\">&nbsp;y&nbsp;</span> ~ <span class=\"boxed\">&nbsp;x&nbsp;</span> , data = <span class=\"boxed\">mydata</span> )</strong> \n  </h2></center>\n  \n  &nbsp;\n\n#### Pieces\n\n<table align = \"center\" >\n  <tr>\n  <th> box </th>\n  <th> fill in with </th>\n  <th> purpose </th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n  <td> `goal` </td>\n  <td> `gf_point` </td>\n  <td> plot some points </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n  <td> `y` </td>\n  <td> `births` </td>\n  <td> y-axis variable</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n  <td> `x` </td>\n  <td> `date` </td>\n  <td> x-axis variable </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n  <td> `mydata` </td>\n  <td> `Births1978`</td>\n  <td> name of data set </td>\n  </tr>\n  </table>\n  \n#### Exercise\n  \n  Put each piece in its place in the template below and then run the code\nto create the plot.\n\n```{r, gf_point, echo = TRUE, exercise = TRUE}\ngoal(y ~ x, data = mydata)\n```\n\n<div id=\"gf_point-hint\">\n  If you get an \"object not found\" or \"could not find function\" error message,\nthat indicates that you have not correctly filled in one of the four boxes from\nthe template.  \n\nNote: R is case sensitive, so watch your capitalization.\n</div>\n  \n  For the record, here are the first few rows of `Births1978`.\n\n```{r}\nBirths1978 %>% head(3) %>% select(births, date, day_of_year)\n```\n\n## Using formulas to describe plots\n\nThe most distinctive feature of `ggformula` plots is the use of formulas to \ndescribe the positional information of a plot.\nFormulas in R always involve the tilde character, which is easy to overlook.\nIt looks like this:  \n  \n&nbsp;\n<center>\n  <h2><strong> <span class=\"boxed\">&nbsp;~&nbsp;</span> </strong> \n  </h2></center>\n  \n  &nbsp;\n\nMake sure you know where the tilde is located on your computer's keyboard! It is often near the upper left-hand corner on American keyboards.\n\n```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = \"center\", out.width = \"40%\"}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/keyboard-tilde.png\")\n```\n\n<!-- #### Exercise -->\n\n<!-- Find the ![](images/tilde-small.png) on your keyboard and type `births ~ date` in  -->\n<!-- the code block.  That's the formula we need for our plot. -->\n  \n  <!-- ```{r type-tilde, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 2} -->\n  \n  <!-- ``` -->\n  \n  <!-- ```{r type-tilde-check, echo = FALSE} -->\n  <!-- set_success_message(\"Good. That's all this exercise was about: typing a formula.\") -->\n  <!-- t1 <- find_call(\"whatever ~ whatever\", message = \"do you have a tilde (~)?  Does your formula have two sides?\") -->\n  <!-- t2 <- find_call(\"births ~ date\", message = \"you need to have the y-axis variable on the left and the x-axis variable on the right\") -->\n  \n  <!-- USER_CODE %>% t1 %>% t2  -->\n  <!-- ``` -->\n  \n  \n### Formula shapes\n  \n  Most `gf_` functions take a formula that describes the positional\nattributes of the plot.  Using one of these functions with no arguments\nwill show you the \"shape\" of the formula it requires.\n\n#### Getting help on formula shapes\nRun this code to see the formula shape for `gf_point()`.\n\n```{r, gf-shape, exercise = TRUE}\ngf_point()\n```\n\nYou should see that `gf_point()`'s formula has the shape `y ~ x`, \nso the $y$-variable name goes before the tilde and the $x$-variable name goes\nafter.  (Think:  \"y depends on x\".  Also note that the $y$-axis label appears\nfarther left than the $x$-axis label.)\n\n#### Order matters in formulas!\n\nReverse the roles of the variables, changing `births ~ date` to \n`date ~ births`. How does the plot change?\n\n```{r, gf_point-xy, echo = TRUE, exercise = TRUE}\ngf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1978)\n```\n\n## Different types of plots\n\nSo far, we have created scatter plots using the function `gf_point()`.  But there are many other `gf_` functions that create different types of plots.  There are also helper functions that can customize axis labels, make multi-panel plots, and more. The following sections will help you explore some of these `gf_` functions.\n\nBefore getting started, just to get an idea of what is included in the ggformula package, run the code below to get a list of all the `gf_` functions that exist (don't worry - we won't cover them *all* today!):\n\n```{r, gf_list, exercise=TRUE}\n# list all functions starting gf_\napropos(\"gf_\")\n```\n\n## Histograms\n\n### The basics\nA histogram can help you visualize the distribution of one quantitative variable.  Since only one variable is involved, we will use a simplified formula structure: ` ~ x `.\n\n### A new dataset\nWe will use a new dataset, called `NHANES` for this example (and many later ones). The `NHANES` dataset contains measurements from 10,000 human subjects in the National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey.  To learn more, run the code `?NHANES`.\n\n### Practice with histograms\nBack to histograms! Try the example as-is, then try the variations below...\n\n1. Experiment with plotting different variables from the NHANES health dataset. (You can use `?` or `names()` or `str()` to get the variable names and more information.) \n2. The input argument `bins` is optional - adjust it to customize the number of bins in your histogram, or leave it out to stick with the default number.\n3. To get density instead of counts on the y-axis, switch from function `gf_histogram` to `gf_dhistogram`.\n\n```{r hist, exercise=TRUE}\ngf_histogram(~BPSysAve, data=NHANES, bins=30)\n```\n\n## Density plots\nA density plot is a smoothed contour tracing the shape of a dataset's distribution.  The function `gf_density` produces these plots:\n\n```{r}\ngf_density(~BPSysAve, data=NHANES) \n```\n\nUnlike histograms, you can overlay density curves for several variables on the same plot to compare them - stay tuned for the \"Multiple Layers with %>%\" section!\n\n\n## Boxplots\nBoxplots, produced using the function `gf_boxplot`, provide a quick overview of the distribution of a quantitative variable.\n\n(*`gf_boxplot` requires a two-sided formula, so if you want to plot just one quantitative variable you have to replace the $x$ in the formula with empty quotes \"\".*)\n\n```{r, boxplot, exercise=TRUE}\ngf_boxplot(BPSysAve ~ \"\", data=NHANES)\n```\n\nBoxplots are usually most useful to compare the distribution of a variable between several groups. \n\n1. Run the code below to see how this works (You're plotting systolic blood pressure for seven groups who watch different amounts of TV each day).\n2. Try changing the order of $x$ and $y$ in the formula -- what happens?\n3. If you are interested, try different variables. Remember, one must be quantitative (that is what you'll make boxplots of) and one categorical (that defines the groups).\n\n```{r, boxplot-groups, exercise=TRUE}\ngf_boxplot(BPSysAve ~ TVHrsDay, data=NHANES)\n```\n\n## Bar graphs\nBar graphs help visualize the distribution of a categorical variable, and we can create them with `gf_bar`. Experiment with the example below:\n\n```{r, bar-graphs, exercise=TRUE}\ngf_bar(~TVHrsDay, data=NHANES)\n```\n\nSometimes, you may be given data that is already tabulated. Instead of a dataset with one row for every case, you will have one row for every group, and a variable that gives the number of observations in each group.  For example, the simple dataset below is pre-tabulated:\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\nD <- data.frame(\n  group = LETTERS[1:3],\n  count = c(20, 25, 18)\n)\nD\n```\n\nWe can use the function `gf_col` to make a bar graph of pre-tabulated data.  This function always expects the counts as the $y$ part of the formula, and the group names as $x$ (after the tilde).\n\n```{r col-plot, exercise=TRUE}\ngf_col(count ~ group, data = D)\n```\n\n## Custom colors and transparency (Optional)\n\nThere were probably things you would like to customize in many of the plots you have created so far.  Maybe you might have preferred different colors or sizes of things, or maybe you would like to include custom axis labels or a plot title.\n\nSuch global characteristics of a plot can be adjusted with additional arguments to\nthe `gf_` function. These go in the `...` part of the template.\n\n&nbsp;\n<center>\n<h3><strong><span class=\"boxed\">goal</span> ( <span class=\"boxed\">&nbsp;y&nbsp;</span> ~ <span class=\"boxed\">&nbsp;x&nbsp;</span> , data = <span class=\"boxed\">mydata</span> , ...)</strong> \n</h3></center>\n&nbsp;\n\nThe general form for these is `option = value`.\n\nFor example, \n\n* `color = \"red\"` or `fill = \"navy\"` (note quotes) can be used to change the colors of things.  (`fill` is typically used for regions that are \"filled in\" and `color` for dots and lines.)\n* `alpha = 0.5` (or any number between 0 and 1) will set the opacity for the objects being plotted (0 is completely\ntransparent and 1 is completely opaque).\n\n\n#### Custom color and transparency\n\nHere are some examples.  Adjust color and alpha options to see how things change.\nWe've inserted some line breaks to make the options easier to locate in the code.\n\n```{r, gf-options-1, exercise = TRUE}\ngf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1978, \n          color = \"navy\")\n```\n\n\n```{r, gf-options-2, exercise = TRUE}\ngf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1978, \n          alpha=0.5, \n          color = \"red\")\n```\n\n```{r, gf-options-3, exercise = TRUE}\ngf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1978, \n         size = 3, shape = 18,\n         alpha = 0.25, color = \"purple\")\n```\n\n\n#### What attributes are available?\n\nYou can learn about the options available for a given plot layer using the \n\"quick help\" for a `gf_` plotting function.  You can find out more by reading the detailed help file produced with `?`.\n\nThe code below will display the \"quick help\".  Have a look, then change it to use `?` and get the full help file.\n\n```{r, quick-help, exercise = TRUE}\n# \"quick help\" for gf_point()\ngf_point()\n```\n\n#### What are the color names?  \n\nCurious to know all the available color names? Run this code.\n\n```{r, colors, exercise = TRUE}\ncolors()\n```\n\nA guide to R colors is also available online at <http://research.stowers.org/mcm/efg/R/Color/Chart/ColorChart.pdf>, if you want to preview which color goes with which name.\n\n## Multiple layers with %>%\n\nWe said that `gf_point()` creates a plot with points. \nThis isn't quite true. Technically, it creates a **layer** with points.\nA single plot may have multiple layers. For example, you might want a scatter plot with a trend line overlaid on it, or a histogram with a standard normal curve overlaid.\n\nTo create a multi-layered plot, simply\nappend `%>%` at the end of the code for one layer and follow that with\nanother layer. *(The `%>%` symbol is called a \"pipe\" because it sends the results of one operation on to the next operation for further processing)*\n\n#### Exercise\n\n1. If you run the following code as is, you will get two separate plots.\n2. Combine these two layers into a single plot by appending `%>%` at\nthe end of the first line.\n3. Try adding another layer for a third variable.\n\n\n```{r multi-layers, exercise = TRUE}\ngf_density(~BPSysAve, data=NHANES) \ngf_density(~BPDiaAve, data=NHANES, fill='blue')\n```\n\n#### Linear regression line\nAdding a (simple) linear regression line to a scatter plot is a relatively common task, and ggformula provides an easy way to do it with the function `gf_lm`.\n\nFor example, we might investigate whether there is a linear relationship between total cholesterol and weight using the NHANES data:\n\n```{r, lm-example, exercise=TRUE}\ngf_point(TotChol~Weight, data=NHANES, alpha=0.1) %>% gf_lm()\n```\n\n## Mapping attributes (Optional)\n\nThe births data in 1978 contains two clear \"waves\" of dots.  One conjecture\nis that these are weekdays and weekends.  We can test this conjecture\nby putting different days in different colors.\n\nIn the lingo of `ggformula`, we need to **map** color to the variable `wday`.\n**Mapping** and **setting** attributes are different in an important way.\n\n* `color = \"navy\"` **sets** the color to \"navy\".  All the dots will be navy.\n\n*  `color = ~ wday` **maps** color to `wday`. This means that the color will \ndepend on the values of `wday`. A legend (aka, a guide) will be \nautomatically included to show us which days are which.\n\n#### Exercise\n\nChange the color argument so that it maps to `wday`.\nDon't forget the tilde (`~`).\n\n```{r, color-mapping, exercise = TRUE}\ngf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1978, color = \"navy\")\n```\n\n```{r color-mapping-quiz}\nquiz(\nquestion(\n\"Does it appear that the conjecture about weekends is generally correct?\",\nanswer(\"yes\", correct = TRUE),\nanswer(\"no\")\n),\nquestion(\n\"What actually happens if you omit the `~` before `~wday`?\",\nanswer(\"It works just the same.  The tilde isn't required.\"),\nanswer(\"All the dots are the same color.\"),\nanswer(\"There is an error message: 'wday' not found.\", correct = TRUE)\n)\n)\n```\n\n## Facets \n\nIf we want to look at all 20 years of birth data, overlaying the data\nis likely to put too much information in too little space and make it hard to tell which\ndata is from which year.  (Even with good color and symbol choices, deciphering 20 colors or 20 shapes is hard.)\nInstead, we can put each year in separate **facet** or sub-plot.  By default the coordinate systems will be shared across the facets\nwhich can make comparisons across facets easier.\n\nThere are two ways to create facets.  The simplest way is to add a vertical bar `|` to\nour formula.\n\n\n```{r, births-facets, exercise = TRUE, fig.height = 6}\ngf_point(births ~ day_of_year | year, data = Births, size = 0.5)\n```\n\nThe second way is to add on a facet command using `%>%`:\n\n```{r, births-facets-wrap, exercise = TRUE, fig.height = 6}\ngf_point(births ~ day_of_year, data = Births, size = 0.5) %>%\ngf_facet_wrap( ~ year)\n```\n\n#### Practice with facets\n\nEdit the plot below to:\n\n1. make one facet for each day of the week (`wday`)\n2. map color to `year`\n\n```{r, births-facets-ex1, exercise = TRUE, fig.height = 6}\ngf_point(births ~ day_of_year, data = Births, \n         size = 0.5, color = \"blue\")\n```\n\n```{r births-facets-ex1-hint}\ngf_point(births ~ day_of_year | wday, data = Births, \n         size = 0.5, color = ~ year)\n```\n\n## Facet Grids and Facet Wraps (Optional)\n\nThe faceting we did on the previous page is called facet wrapping.  If the facets\ndon't fit nicely in one row, the facets continue onto additional rows.\n\nA facet grid uses rows, or columns, or both in a fixed way.\n\nNotice that after the `|` there is now a *formula* instead of a single variable.  Try generating the plot below - can you figure out what the formula does?  If you need a hint, try changing `year ~ wday` to `wday ~ year` and see what happens... \n\n```{r, facet-grid, exercise = TRUE, fig.height = 9}\ngf_point(births ~ day_of_year | year ~ wday, data = Births, size = 0.5)\n```\n\n## The facet grid formula (Optional)\nHopefully, you figured out that the facet grid formula is interpreted as \"row variable ~ column variable\" -- the resulting plot will have one row of facets for every value of the first variable, and one column of facets for every value of the second variable.\n\n#### Pracice with the facet grid formula\n\nRecreate the plot above using `gf_facet_grid()`.  This works much like `gf_facet_wrap()`\nand accepts a formula with one of three shapes\n\n* `y ~ x` (facets along both axes)\n* ` ~ x`  (facets only along x-axis)\n* `y ~ .` (facets only along y-axis; notice the important dot in this one)  \n\n(These three formula shapes can also be used on the right side of `|`.)\n\n\n```{r, facet-grid2, exercise = TRUE, fig.height = 9}\n```\n\n## Customization\n\nYou may be wondering how to have more control over \nthings like:\n\n* the colors, shapes, and sizes chosen when mapping attributes\n* labeling, including titles and axis labels\n* fonts, colors, and sizes of text\n* color of plot elements like background, gridlines, facet labels, etc.\n\nAs you can imagine, all of these things can be adjusted pretty much however you like.  We will cover a few of the most common options here.\n\n## Custom labels\nOne of the most common customizations you will want to make to your plots will be to change the title, subtitle, and axis labels (and maybe add a caption).  All these things can be done by chaining (`%>%`) the function `gf_labs()` with a plot layer.\n\nCheck out the example below, and try changing the text labels to ones that make sense to you. Note that all the input arguments to `gf_labs` are optional. So, for example, you could alter *only* the x-axis label by chaining the command `gf_labs(x='My X Axis Label')` with your plot.\n\n```{r gf-labs-example, exercise=TRUE}\ngf_bar(~Race1, data=NHANES) %>%\n  gf_labs(title = \"Race in NHANES Data\",\n    subtitle = \"(2009-2012)\",\n    caption = \"These data were collected by the US National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which has conducted a series of health and nutrition surveys since the early 1960's.\",\n    x = \"\",  # empty quotes here results in no x-axis label!\n    y = \"Number of Observations\"\n  )\n```\n\n## Custom axis limits\nOne way to zoom in (or out) is to filter the dataset so that only the data you wish to plot is included.\n\nYou can also use `gf_lims()` to set custom x and y axis limits. \n\n1. Try different axis limits to see how the plot changes.\n2. What happens if you set the min or max value for an axis to NA? (Hint: compare the plot to a plot with *no* custom axis limits.)\n3. What happens if you set the axis limits to be c(max, min) instead of c(min,max)?\n\n```{r axis-limits, exercise=TRUE}\ngf_point(births ~ day_of_year, data = Births1978) %>%\n  gf_lims(x=c(100,200), y=c(8000,9000))\n```\n\n## Themes\n\n### Using predefined themes\nA number of predefined themes exist that control the appearance of non-data elements of plots. In this tutorial, we set the default theme using\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}\ntheme_set(theme_bw())\n```\n\nOther themes include `theme_minimal()`, `theme_classic()`, `theme_gray()`, `theme_light()`, `theme_map()`, and `theme_quickmap()`. The ggthemes package includes some additional themes, including `theme_economist()`, `theme_economist_white()`, `theme_excel()`,  `theme_fivethirtyeight()`, `theme_stata()`, `theme_tufte()`, and `theme_wsj()`. Many of these themes mimic the look of other software packages or of popular publications.\n\nThe theme can be set for an individual plot using `gf_theme()` -- for example:\n\n```{r gf_theme-example, echo=TRUE}\ngf_bar(~Race1, data=NHANES) %>%\n  gf_theme(theme = theme_wsj())\n```\n\n### Test some themes\nChoose some different themes in place of `theme_wsj()` and see how the resulting plot changes.\n\n```{r gf_theme-example2, exercise=TRUE}\ngf_bar(~Race1, data=NHANES) %>%\n  gf_theme(theme = theme_wsj())\n```\n\n## Changing text font sizes\nThemes have optional arguments. One of the most useful is `base_size`, which controls the base font size (in points). (*`base_size` is an input argument to the theme, so it goes inside the parentheses after the theme name...* ) Try adjusting the font size and theme in the figure below - what theme and size do you think are optimal?\n\n```{r gf_theme-example3, exercise=TRUE}\ngf_bar(~Race1, data=NHANES) %>%\n  gf_theme(theme = theme_wsj(base_size=6))\n```\n\n## Your Turn\n\nIf you got this far, maybe it's time to explore on your own!  Here are three data sets you can use.\n\n* `HELPrct` has data from a study of people addicted to alcohol, cocaine, or heroine\n* `KidsFeet` has information about some kids' feet.\n* `NHANES` has lots of physiologic and other measurements from 10,000\nsubjects in the National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey.\n\nTo find out more about the data sets use `?HELPrct`, `?KidsFeet`, or  `?NHANES`.\nTo see the first few rows of the data, you can use `head()`.\n\nTo get a list of functions available in `ggformula`, run this code chunk.\n\n```{r, apropos, exercise = TRUE}\n# list all functions starting gf_\napropos(\"gf_\")\n```\n\n#### Exercise.\n\nMake some plots to explore one or more of these data sets.\n\n* Experiment with different types of plots.\n* Use mapping and/or facets to reveal groups.\n* You can put more than one plot in a code chunk, but we've provided two chunks\nin case you want to separate your work that way.  Use one chunk for experimenting\nand copy and paste your favorites to the other chunk if you like.\n\n```{r, explore, exercise = TRUE}\ngf_point(length ~ width, data = KidsFeet)\nhead(KidsFeet)\n?KidsFeet\n```\n\n```{r, explore-more, exercise = TRUE}\n\n```\n",
